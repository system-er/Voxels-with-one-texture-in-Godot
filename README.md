# Voxels-with-one-texture-in-Godot
programmed with C# for Godot 4. only for fun.    
- all voxels have one texture.
- all voxels with the same texture are created in one mesh.
- if there are voxels beside - the faces are not generated.   
not recommended for things like games, cause for example theres no chunks.
